# Shifubriq

## What is this?

Shifubriq is a game you can play on Slack thanks to [briq](https://www.givebriq.com/). By launching the command `/shifubriq @user` you'll start a shifubriq game.
The other player is able to launch the same command to join it, and the winner steals 1 briq to the loser ðŸ™ƒ
